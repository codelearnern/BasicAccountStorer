This is an account storer I have created during like 2 hours or so.
THIS IS VERY BASIC.

How it works is basically there is a master password you have to remember.
To store new accounts and view existing accounts, you have to type in the master password correctly.
All the accounts you have created are stored in a sqlite database.  
I have also implemented hashing for the master password just to add a basic level of security.

Please suggest any improvements and hope you like it :)
